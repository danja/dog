# DOG-1
'Danny's Obtuse Gadget'

Playing with a cheapo TM1638 card driven by an Arduino Uno. Trying to put together a simple single-board computer a bit like the Kim-1, except with two boards and my own instruction set etc.

If written up the [design](https://github.com/danja/dog/blob/master/docs/overview.md) as far as instruction set (still a lot to be decided around there - will probably make most of that up as I go along). 

*Status* : UI, program input implemented.

This blog post gave me enough to get started:
